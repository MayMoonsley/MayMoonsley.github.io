    <h1>Welcome to the New Site</h1>
    <p>Howdy, everybody! Welcome to the new website. No more WordPress; this website is built entirely out of raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes things simpler (kinda) on my end &mdash; I can just stick whatever into a blog post and have it work, without having to bother with WYSIWYG stuff. I think I might have been able to do that before, but this way I'm more like <a href="http://www.tailsteak.com">the great Tailsteak</a>. (Tailsteak is also why I went for the black background. Nice and easy on the eyes.)</p>
    <p>I kept trying to type up more justifications as to why I'm abandoning WordPress for static HTML, but I doubt that's why you're here. I'll be sure to have some more stuff up on the site in the coming days. (Probably posts about emoji or music or something.) Catch you on the flip side.</p>
